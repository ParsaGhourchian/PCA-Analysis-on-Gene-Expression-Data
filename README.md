# PCA Analysis on Gene Expression Data

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a clean gene expression dataset to reduce dimensionality and visualize biological variation.
The dataset is first normalized using StandardScaler, then transformed into two principal components (PC1 and PC2).
The resulting PCA scatter plot and explained variance scores help understand patterns in the data.

📌 Features

Standardization of high-dimensional gene expression data

PCA dimensionality reduction (2 components)

Scatter plot visualization of PC1 vs PC2
